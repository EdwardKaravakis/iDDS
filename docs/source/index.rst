Welcome to iDDS's documentation!
================================

iDDS(intelligent Data Delivery Service) is an intelligent Data Delivery Service. It's designed
 to intelligently transform and deliver the needed data to the processing workflow in a
fine-grained approach for High Energy Physics workloads. It will not only reduce the need for 
replicas, but also enable benefits such as decreasing the time period of caching transient data,
transforming expensive replicas to cheaper format data at remote sites and only cache cheaper
new data for processing. iDDS will also work to orchestrate the WorkFlow Management System (WFMS)
and the Distributed Data Management (DDM) systems to trigger them to process the data as soon as
possible. In addition, iDDS will have intelligent algorithms to adjust the lifetime of cache,
the format transformation and the delivery destination. The iDDS will increase the efficiency of
data usage, reduce storage usage for processing and speed up the processing workflow.

iDDS is developed with modular and is highly scalable with plugin structure.
